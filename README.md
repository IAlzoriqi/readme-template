Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this line and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**
